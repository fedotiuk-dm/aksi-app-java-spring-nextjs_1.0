## Cost Calculation Logic

### 1. Rules for Applying Discounts and Surcharges

- Order-wide discounts do not apply to washing, ironing, and textile dyeing services
- Additional service surcharges are calculated first, then discounts are applied
- When multiple surcharges apply, they are added to base price sequentially (not multiplied)

### 2. Cost Calculation Process for Each Item

1. **Base Price** (from price list based on category and name)
2. **Color Product Check** - different price for black and other colors
3. **Special Modifier Application** - some may replace base price
4. **Multiplier Application** - coefficients for material, condition, additional services
5. **Fixed Service Addition** - for example, button sewing
6. **Urgency** (if selected): +50% or +100% to intermediate sum
7. **Discounts** (if applicable and allowed for this category)
8. **Rounding** to kopecks (2 decimal places)

### 3. Smart Dependencies and Automation

- When selecting category, automatically updates:

  - List of available names
  - List of possible materials
  - Set of available additional services
  - Unit of measure (pcs/kg)
  - Expected completion time

- When selecting urgency:

  - Automatic recalculation of all item costs
  - Completion date update

- When selecting certain contamination types:
  - System automatically suggests relevant additional services
  - Risk warnings may appear
